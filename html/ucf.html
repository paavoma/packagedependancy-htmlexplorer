<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.</p>
<p> Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be</p>
<p> preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior</p>
<p> is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg</p>
<p> handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as</p>
<p> needed.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default</p>
<p> version that will work for most installations, although some system</p>
<p> administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the</p>
<p> default version will be part of the package distribution, and must</p>
<p> not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at</p>
<p> any other time).</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that</p>
<p> may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,</p>
<p> but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to</p>
<p> maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general</p>
<p> offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally</p>
<p> provides for 'conffiles'.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a</p>
<p> file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come</p>
<p> under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at</p>
<p> installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the</p>
<p> one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to</p>
<p> conffile status.</p>
