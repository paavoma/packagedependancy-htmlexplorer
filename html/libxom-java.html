<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>A new XML object model for Java</p>
<p> XOM(tm) is a new XML object model. It is an open source (LGPL),</p>
<p> tree-based API for processing XML with Java that strives for correctness,</p>
<p> simplicity, and performance, in that order.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very</p>
<p> straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming</p>
<p> you're already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and</p>
<p> running with XOM very quickly.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness.</p>
<p> XOM only accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows</p>
<p> you to create namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a</p>
<p> little stricter than that: it actually guarantees that all documents</p>
<p> are round-trippable and have well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages</p>
<p> your XML so you don't have to. With XOM, you can focus on the unique</p>
<p> value of your application, and trust XOM to get the XML right.</p>
