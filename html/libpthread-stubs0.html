<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>pthread stubs not provided by native libc</p>
<p> This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided</p>
<p> in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely</p>
<p> on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when</p>
<p> linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running</p>
<p> single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on</p>
<p> platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.  On</p>
<p> platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this</p>
<p> package has no content.</p>
