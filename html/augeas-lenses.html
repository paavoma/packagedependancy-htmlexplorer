<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Set of lenses needed by libaugeas0 to parse config files</p>
<p> Augeas parses configuration files described in lenses into a tree structure,</p>
<p> which it exposes through its public API. Changes made through the API are</p>
<p> written back to the initially read files.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Lenses are the building blocks of the file <-> tree transformation; they</p>
<p> combine parsing a file and building the tree (the get transformation), with</p>
<p> turning the tree back into an (updated) file (the put transformation).</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting</p>
<p> details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file</p>
<p> format and the transformation into a tree. This package includes the official</p>
<p> set of lenses.</p>
