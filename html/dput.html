<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Debian package upload tool</p>
<p> dput allows you to put one or more Debian packages into the archive.  This</p>
<p> package also includes a dcut utility which can be used to generate and / or</p>
<p> upload a commands file for the Debian FTP archive upload queue.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> dput includes some tests to verify that the package is policy-compliant.</p>
<p> It offers the possibility to run lintian before the upload. It can also</p>
<p> run dinstall in dry-run-mode, when having used an appropriate upload method.</p>
<p> This is very useful to see if the upload will pass dinstall sanity checks</p>
<p> in the next run.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> It is intended mainly for Debian maintainers only, although it can</p>
<p> also be useful for people maintaining local apt repositories.</p>
