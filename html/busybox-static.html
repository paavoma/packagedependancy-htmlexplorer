<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Standalone rescue shell with tons of builtin utilities</p>
<p> BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single</p>
<p> small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common</p>
<p> utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,</p>
<p> mount, tar, etc.).  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than</p>
<p> their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included</p>
<p> provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU</p>
<p> counterparts.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell</p>
<p> that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is</p>
<p> intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your</p>
<p> system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save</p>
<p> your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the</p>
<p> available builtin commands.</p>
