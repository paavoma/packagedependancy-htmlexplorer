<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>GNU grep, egrep and fgrep</p>
<p> 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the</p>
<p> command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages</p>
<p> on your system probably will.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".</p>
<p> GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about</p>
<p> twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper</p>
<p> search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being</p>
<p> considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to</p>
<p> look at every character. The result is typically many times faster</p>
<p> than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing</p>
<p> will run more slowly, however.)</p>
