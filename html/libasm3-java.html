<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Java bytecode manipulation framework</p>
<p> It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy classes,</p>
<p> directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at load time, i.e.,</p>
<p> just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much smaller</p>
<p> (25KB instead of 350KB for BCEL and 150KB for SERP) and faster</p>
<p> than these tools (the overhead of a load time class transformation is on</p>
<p> the order of 60% with ASM, 700% or more with BCEL, and 1100% or more with</p>
<p> SERP). ASM was designed to be used in a dynamic and static way and was</p>
<p> therefore designed and implemented to be as small and as fast as possible.</p>
