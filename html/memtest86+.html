<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>thorough real-mode memory tester</p>
<p> Memtest86+ scans your RAM for errors.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer</p>
<p> boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to</p>
<p> look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,</p>
<p> but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel</p>
<p> patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent</p>
<p> hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,</p>
<p> including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.</p>
