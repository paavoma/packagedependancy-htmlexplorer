<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>report the search path for a class's ISA tree</p>
<p> Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via</p>
<p> its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from</p>
<p> Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may</p>
<p> themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as</p>
<p> above).</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl</p>
<p> first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes</p>
<p> searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe</p>
<p> "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in</p>
<p> Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then</p>
<p> Chemicals.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the</p>
<p> list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with</p>
<p> no duplicates.</p>
