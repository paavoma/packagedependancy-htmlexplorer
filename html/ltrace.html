<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>Tracks runtime library calls in dynamically linked programs</p>
<p> ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it</p>
<p> exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records</p>
<p> the dynamic library calls which are called by</p>
<p> the executed process and the signals received by that process.</p>
<p> It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can</p>
<p> use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the</p>
<p> execution of processes.</p>
