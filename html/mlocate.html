<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name</p>
<p> mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files</p>
<p> anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern</p>
<p> or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses</p>
<p> a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries</p>
<p> to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from</p>
<p> cron.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation</p>
<p> from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate</p>
<p> are:</p>
<p> .</p>
<p>  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only</p>
<p>    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does</p>
<p>    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for</p>
<p>    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate</p>
<p>    does this as well, but not the original locate.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p>  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time</p>
<p>    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its</p>
<p>    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without</p>
<p>    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding</p>
<p>    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to</p>
<p> mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may</p>
<p> wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,</p>
<p> otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself</p>
<p> (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).</p>
<p> Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have</p>
<p> two different database files updated regularly on your system.</p>
