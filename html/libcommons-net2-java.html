<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>internet protocol suite Java library</p>
<p> This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by</p>
<p> ORO, Inc. This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,</p>
<p> NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well</p>
<p> as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide</p>
<p> fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,</p>
<p> some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our</p>
<p> philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible</p>
<p> (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide</p>
<p> access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the</p>
<p> programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP</p>
<p> packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are</p>
<p> exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after</p>
<p> ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who</p>
<p> found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version</p>
<p> 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have</p>
<p> expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under</p>
<p> the Apache Software License.</p>
