<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>symptom scripts for apport</p>
<p> Apport intercepts program crashes, collects debugging information about the</p>
<p> crash and the operating system environment, and sends it to bug trackers in a</p>
<p> standardized form. It also offers the user to report a bug about a package,</p>
<p> with again collecting as much information about it as possible.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> This package extends Apport by some "symptom" scripts, so that bug reporters</p>
<p> do not have to guess the correct package, but report problems based on</p>
<p> symptoms that they have (like "sound problem"), through an interactive process.</p>
