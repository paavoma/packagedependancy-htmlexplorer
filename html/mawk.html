<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>a pattern scanning and text processing language</p>
<p> Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK</p>
<p> language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and</p>
<p> processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk</p>
<p> is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,</p>
<p> Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley</p>
<p> Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms</p>
<p> to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language</p>
<p> which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk</p>
<p> provides a small number of extensions.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time</p>
<p> limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.</p>
