<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>A system call tracer</p>
<p> strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out</p>
<p> a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.</p>
<p> The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can</p>
<p> use it on binaries for which you don't have source.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel</p>
<p> interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug</p>
<p> isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.</p>
