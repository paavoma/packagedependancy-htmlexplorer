<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>File comparison utilities</p>
<p> The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file</p>
<p> in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where</p>
<p> two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that</p>
<p> differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences</p>
<p> among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute</p>
<p> updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.</p>
<p> This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared</p>
<p> to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can</p>
<p> update, or "patch", a copy of the file.</p>
